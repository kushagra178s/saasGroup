## Community Management SaaS Platform: Project Specification

**Introduction:**

This document outlines the development of a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform empowering users to create and manage online communities. Users can register, establish communities, invite members, and exercise various functionalities for effective community management.

**User Roles:**

- **Community Admin:** Users who create communities automatically assume this role, granting full control over their respective communities.
- **Community Member:** Users invited by admins to join specific communities, possessing limited functionalities within those communities.

**Functional Requirements:**

**Module: Authentication**

1. **User Registration:** Users can create accounts using a valid name, email address, and a strong password that adheres to defined security standards.
2. **User Login:** Users can authenticate using their registered email address and password, implementing secure login practices.

**Module: Community Management**

1. **Community Listing:** Users can view a comprehensive list of all available communities within the platform.
2. **Community Creation:** Users can establish new communities by providing a chosen name and a descriptive summary.

**Module: Community Moderation**

1. **Member Listing:** Community admins can access a list of all members within their respective communities.
2. **Member Invitation:** Admins can invite other users to join their communities, granting them "Community Member" roles.
3. **Member Removal:** Admins can remove members from their communities, effectively managing community membership.

**Technical Specifications:**

- **Programming Language:** Node.js v14+ (or a newer LTS version)
- **Database:** Select one from PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB based on project requirements and preferences.
- **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM):** Choose from Sequelize, Prisma, Mongoose, or MongoDB Native Driver for efficient data interaction.
- **Unique ID Generation:** Utilize the `@theinternetfolks/snowflake` library to generate unique identifiers for entities, ensuring data integrity and avoiding conflicts.

**Constraints:**

- **Strict Role Nomenclature:** "Community Admin" and "Community Member" are the only permissible roles within the platform.
- **Predefined API Endpoints and Response Structures:** Specific URLs and response formats must be adhered to for consistent API interaction.
- **Enforced Database Schema:** Database table structures and field attributes are predetermined and must be followed for data consistency.
- **NoSQL ID Handling:** When using NoSQL databases, the addition of fields to store unique identifiers is permitted for compatibility.
- **Mandatory API Validation:** Each API request must undergo thorough validation to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid inputs.

**Project Deliverables:**

- **Comprehensive API documentation:** Detailed specifications for each API endpoint, including request parameters, response formats, and error handling mechanisms.
- **Functional backend implementation:** Developed using the chosen language, database, ORM, and ID generation library, incorporating robust validation checks for all API requests.
- **Unit and integration tests:** Implemented to ensure the functionality and reliability of the developed APIs.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Database Schema Design:** Define the database tables, relationships, and constraints based on user roles, communities, and membership details.
2. **API Design:** Plan and document the specific API endpoints for each user story, adhering to the defined URLs and response structures.
3. **Implementation:** Develop the backend APIs using the chosen technologies, incorporating security best practices, error handling, and logging mechanisms.
4. **Frontend Development:** (Optional) Build a user-friendly interface to interact with the APIs, enabling users to register, sign in, manage communities, and access various functionalities.

**Conclusion:**

This project specification provides a comprehensive framework for developing a robust and secure community management SaaS platform. By adhering to the outlined requirements, constraints, and deliverables, you can create a valuable tool for users to build and manage thriving online communities. Remember to adapt and customize this framework based on your specific project needs and chosen technologies.
